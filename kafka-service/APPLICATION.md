Running Kakfa-Dispatcher as Application
---
The first time, you need to build the project from the sources by executing the following script:

    ./packageDispatcher.sh
    
Then, you can simply execute:

    ./runApp.sh
    
to start the application. By default, it uses the `application.yml` file in the current folder as [configuration](doc/CONFIGURATION.md) file.
